## Swerve drive

* Drive motor position
  * Motors not on turning section
    * Inertia is higher if the drive motor turns too. Possibly the rotating parts of the motor
      also influence the rotation due to gyroscopic forces
    * Power wires eventually tangled after too many turns
    * Motor at wheel height is more susceptible to dirt
    * Reduces clearance because motors take up space
* Drive motor power transfer
  * Options
    * Belts
      * Easier
      * Lighter
      * Allows non-parallel axles
      * Less efficient
      * Requires pre-tension
      * When changing speed or direction there is a lag
    * Chains
      * Easier
      * Lighter
      * More efficient than belt, but less efficient than gears
      * Does not require pre-tension
      * Axles have to be parallel. Little tolerance
      * When changing speed or direction there is a lag
    * Gears
      * Most efficient (if properly set up)
      * Can transfer large amounts of torque
      * Need to be over short distance
      * Noisy at high speed
      * Need lubrication
      * A herringbone or helical gear would be most efficient but those are expensive
  * Should really have a cover over the bottom so that we don't get dirt in the drive system
