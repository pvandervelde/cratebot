- Maintenance / troubleshooting


### Software

- Motor control
- Steering control
- Height control
- Sensing
- Path finding
- Environment discovery
- coordination between multiple rovers
  - Requesting help from other rovers
  - Communicate capabilities
- Clamping
- Control of cargo
  - Stability calculations
  - Effect of cargo on pathing

### Assembly

- Creation of the structure
- Attachment of drives

## Approach

### drive

- 2 casters; 2 wheel differential drive
- 2 fixed drive wheel; 2 steering wheel
- 2 fixed wheel; 2 steering, drive wheel
- 4 steering, drive wheel
- 6 steering, drive wheel
- 8 steering, drive wheel
