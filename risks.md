# Risks

This document describes the risks in the CrateRover project

## Areas

### Concept

- Size
- Strength
- Sizing of motors - Power / Torgue


### Hardware

- Suspension system
- Steering system
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_bearing
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapered_roller_bearing
  - Accuracy of rotation
  - Speed of rotation
  - Construction / assembly
- Drive system
- structure
  - Load calculations
- Maintenance

## Electronics

- Processing
- Power control / Charge / Discharge
- Communication
- Sensors
- Maintenance / troubleshooting


### Software

- Motor control
- Steering control
- Height control
- Sensing
- Path finding
- Environment discovery
- coordination between multiple rovers
  - Requesting help from other rovers
  - Communicate capabilities
- Clamping
- Control of cargo
  - Stability calculations
  - Effect of cargo on pathing

### Assembly

- Creation of the structure
- Attachment of drives

## Risk order

- Construction -> Suspension, Steering
- Electronics

## Approach

### drive

- 2 casters; 2 wheel differential drive
- 2 fixed drive wheel; 2 steering wheel
- 2 fixed wheel; 2 steering, drive wheel
- 4 steering, drive wheel
- 6 steering, drive wheel
- 8 steering, drive wheel
